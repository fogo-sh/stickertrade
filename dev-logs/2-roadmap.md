# dev log 2 - roadmap

_2022-03-24_

Small entry in comparison to 1, but I made a little roadmap!

<img src="/images/dev-logs/2/roadmap.webp" alt="TODO">

Just sits at `/roadmap` currently, might be a bit more ambitious / descriptive in the future, but for now its just a basic list of things I am either:

- Currently working on
- Am planning to work on afterwards
- Will (hopefully) get to eventually

This can kinda act as my own little GitHub issues-esq thing, that is publicly accessible on the website itself.
