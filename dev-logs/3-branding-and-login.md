Lapse in logs, but I'm back!

## Branding

I'm not fully settled on the look and feel of this site just yet, but I spent some time working on a 'branding' page, to have quick access to the hex values I've currently defined for the theme for the site and such.

<img src="/images/dev-logs/3/branding-page.webp" alt="Current view of the branding page, with the new header (that is just homepage link + new login link), the content of the branding page (hex colors on display, along with the new logo, and footer containing what was once in header (roadmap, branding, and dev logs links)">

Noticeable above:

- I've added a footer to the site, and moved all of the old random sub-pages to it.
- The new header is just homepage link and login / logout buttons), more on that found below.
- (yet another placeholder thing likely) a logo!

<img src="/images/dev-logs/3/current-favicon.svg" alt="Current favicon / logo of the site, a slightly peeled off sticker with a gradient on its front, and the white of the peeled off area visible" class="w-1/2 mx-auto p-2">

Hand-edited SVG (that's actually just the sites favicon), which uses the brand colors, and is meant to look like a partially peeled sticker with the white on its top right.

## Login

Basic login has been built.

<video src="/images/dev-logs/3/login.webm" alt="Demo of logging into the application, with examples of form validation by putting in values that are either invalid user credentials, or too short" controls></video>

Stolen mostly from the Remix example 'Jokes' app, we've got basic bcrypt-validated session-based authentication working.

No registration yet, hence users are still only just populated by seeding the database, and the only schema change was to add a `passwordHash` attribute to the `Users` table.

### Form Validation

Remix has very decent examples of how you can do form validation, but as someone who is acustom to [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), I wanted something similar to this within Remix, and it exists!

[Remix Validated Form](https://www.remix-validated-form.io/) is pretty much exactly what I was looking for.

I had heard good things about [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), which the above perfectly integrates with:

```tsx
export const validator = withZod(
  z.object({
    username: z
      .string()
      .nonempty("Username is required")
      .min(3, { message: "Username must be at least 3 characters" }),
    password: z
      .string()
      .nonempty("Password is required")
      .min(6, { message: "Password must be at least 6 characters" }),
  })
);
```

The above defines a 'validator' that can run on serverside and clientside, that basically encapsulates all of the logic for validation for me (you can also use methods within Zod to introspect validators to get valid type definitions from them, since it is TypeScript first).


```tsx
export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const { formId, data, error } = await validator.validate(
    await request.formData()
  );

  if (error) return validationError(error);

  const { username, password } = data;

  const user = await login({ username, password });

  if (!user) {
    return validationError(
      {
        fieldErrors: {
          password: "Login failed",
        },
        formId: formId,
      },
      data
    );
  }

  return createUserSession(user.id, "/");
};
```

I then define an 'action' function, which is basically something Remix will make a post request to clientside when it wants to do fancy things, and I use the `validator` to fetch data from the form body of the `POST` request, and then invoke `login` (something internal that returns user metadata if the username / password combo is correct).

If I don't get an user back from `login`, I error the form with validation error on password, and otherwise, I create a user session (more internal plumbing that sets a cookie and then returns a redirection status code).

```tsx
export default function Index() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-sm mx-auto">
      <ValidatedForm validator={validator} method="post">
        <FormInput name="username" label="Username" />
        <FormInput name="password" label="Password" type="password" />
        <SubmitButton
          className="mt-3"
          submit="Login"
          submitting="Logging in..."
        />
      </ValidatedForm>
    </main>
  );
}
```

The smallest bit of code is the actual JSX, partially due to the inputs and submit button being mostly defined and styled elsewhere (but still within my project so I have full control over them, very headless).
